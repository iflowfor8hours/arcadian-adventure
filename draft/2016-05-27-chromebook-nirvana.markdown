TODO: Make a timeline, illustrated?

This post is a long highly personal and autobigraphical about my emotional relationship with laptops. some personal and probably irrelevant choices to you, regarding the history of computers I have owned. The result of which is that I now have a Chromebook Pixel 2, running GalliumOS, and it is the best computing experience I have had up to this point. My position is slanted and unfair, and on top of that, I'm a linux user. If you are not interested in ThinkPads, linux as a daily driver, or the Chromebook Pixel, this is going to be very very boring.

#### Mobility smells like children

My history with desktops is very different and far more common, so I've left a lot of it out. Assume that in the gaps between laptops, I had some sort of desktop, and my first computer was certainly a IBM PC baby AT with a CGA display. However, laptops are special to me. Even as a child I travelled a lot on planes. My first flight carrying a computer  was in 1991, at 6 years old and have not since stopped travelling or carrying a laptop. We flew a lot as a family because my mother travelled for work close to 9 months out of the year, and frequently she took us with her. In the summer, we would fly to Vegas to stay with my family there, so my mother could travel for work. During those summers my sister and I would fly unacommpanied minor style to go meet her in places where she had to stay for a week or more to visit with us on weekends.

{{ when was the TSA formed? }} 

We would fly and I would carry the computer because I was the most interested in it. I was always afraid of the supposed magnets in the x-ray machines destroying my computer, so I insisted that they check my computer by hand and not run it through the scanner. The test to check if it was a bomb or not, was the often amused **airline** security guard would ask the 6 year old with the laptop to kindly turn it on and show that something showed up on the screen. This meant booting it, and wasting precious battery life, of which there was only around 18 minutes of on my first one. Upon the bios appearing on the screen, the guard would then wave me on with some comment about how cute or weird it was that I had a computer to my mother or me, and let out a laugh about how I must be really important, or from Wall Street, in New York, New York, the Big Apple! A place where many people had never been and thought of as very exotic I learned very quickly.

Thankfully I was awkward and shy and could just blush and close it up and get on with moving to my gate and begin thinking like a janitor to find a place to plug in. Very few people at this technology drought moment in time had portable electronics they carried around everywhere and were concerned about electricity.

### Toshiba on the teat

The first laptop I ever used was a {{WHAT WAS IT?}}. I played The Secret of Monkey Island on it, ran Windows 3.1 sometimes, and was obsessed with the trackball that clipped on the side of it. I remember the contrast adjustment on the side of the screen being so intense, seeing the colors change drastically, and when point-and-clicks with friends, we all had to sit nearly on each others laps because the viewing angle was so terrible. It also had a monochrome mode that turned everything blue and white, which I would flick on and off while I waited for things to load from the internal floppy drive, because it was hardware driven. I remember trying to play DOOM on it but the refresh rate and ghosting was so bad that it was unplayable without memorizing levels and monster locations. Being 7 at the time, the solution was obvious. Memorize the game by dedicating every waking moment I was allowed near this machine to complete the game.

### Learning about the guts of the boxes

Noting my interest in computers, in 4th grade my mother bought me what I now know to be a $5000, 6 week summer course in which we ordered a dell computer, and I hung out with a lady at the FutureKids center on {{ ADDRESS of FUTUREKIDS }} and she helped me take the whole thing apart, explaning everything to me, piece by piece. I learned about hard drives, PCI and ISA cards, RAM, SCSI (I didn't have it), ATA, IDE, on-board PC speaker vs SoundBlaster sounds, and everything else while we took it apart. We pulled everything out of the case and touched every part, learning more by seeing and touching the hardware. Every day I was pining for the time I went to camp, even going so far as to watch richard scary's smalltown, which I hated, just because it passed the time right before I could meet up with Michelle, the love of my life. We put the computer back together in the same slow pace, quizzing me and joking around with me, and building my confidence in what I knew and didn't know.

After dell was back together, we installed DOS on it. She taught me the boot order, how the computer looked for a sector, and why the sounds coming from the machine came from the floppy first, the high pitched one, then a low pitched one, the HDD, then a click, then a beep. 
I was in heaven. This woman was so cool and so pretty to me, and she taking the next month off to cycle from NYC to California. For no reason. 
{{ Marina? }}

After installing DOS, we moved on to windows, and then to installing other software. Color inkjet printer drivers, a scanner, and paint shop, or some kidpix knockoff. The end result being able to edit a photo that I took, got developed, scanned, then opened in paint shop pro. This is where the image above came from. She taught me how to connect a sound card card and get it working, which I didn't own but she let me borrow because she was cool like that. We installed a few games, [The Incredible Machine](TIM_) I remember playing a bit of, before moving back into programming in QBASIC and tinkering endlessly with making menus for things and games in ZZT. Unfortunately, this was where it ended with {{ marina }} and I. She was off on her collosal bike trip, and I got to take my computer home and love and own for a very very long time.

### ThinkPad first love

My first real laptop, meaning which I had sole ownership and agency over and which I had convinced myself to "get work done" was a {{ Thinkpad tiny one }} with an external floppy drive. It was given to me by my mother when she resigned from her job and they let her keep her work machine. It was loaded with Lotus Notes, Windows NT4, and a host of other software I could not have given a shit less about, but kept around just in case I was secretly a business person. At that time, I was programing in QBASIC, tearing it up in Norton Commander, playing LucasArts games, and pirating PSX games and CDs with the help of an enormous cd burner via my PCMCIA SCSI interface. This was my most prized possession, as it was the source of my young income and literally the coolest thing I had ever seen.

TODO: Determine what the history actually was, noting that you did havea PCMCIA 33.6 modem at one point, and an ethernet card with an orange interface when you turned 16. I believe that is when the PowerBook G4 came out and you flip flopped for a few years.

{{ tech specs and photos of thinkpad }}

The defining moment in the relationship between myself and the ThinkPad brand was when I was in my aunts house, looking at porn on my laptop, in a heightened state of alert because everyone was home and downstairs. My aunt called me from downstairs to do something for her, and in a frenzy I closed the windows with the images open in it, and ran down the stairs holding my laptop in one hand and the bannister in the other. At the top of the stairs I stopped to think if I had closed _all_ of the things I didn't want anyone to see, and the computer slipped out of my hand. The next few seconds happened in unforgettable {{ HOW OLD MIND }} slow motion. I watched the computer fly out of my hand and cartwheel down the stairs, hitting one after another on different corners and gaining momentum untill eventually coming to rest at the landing after slamming into the wall right above the dog bed. The whole house heard it and thought I had fallen or something because I unconciously gave a painstaking squeal as the clamour echoed. The sounds it made were akin to the metallic and unmistakably mechanical crash of an expensive 35mm SLR slamming onto the hard, smooth, polished floor of the baggage claim area as an overtired father leans down to pick up an equally distressed screaming child, forgetting that the olympus with new zoom lens is dangling from his neck. Heartbreaking. Expensive. Utterly world-crushing and ultimately irrepariable.

{{ Insert pic of stairs at kathleens house }}

I raced down the stairs after it and picked it up, knowing that I would never have a computer again. That was it. I saw the wreckage and knew that God found out, and now He has broke my laptop for being naughty. The catholic guilt was already turning my whole body deeply red as I saw that the clean, angular, and entirely utilitarian black body was chipped along the corners. The latch to hold the screen closed was laying by my feet. God had punished me for looking at grainy BMPs of a naked women laying on a checkered print duvet, with some other geometric patterns. I swapped a copy of commander keen for this filth [sneaker-net](http://www.sneakernet.com) style from a slovak friend of my babysitter who had a modem with a paralell port, and knew how to use BBSs. This was something I had sacraficed for mobility, early on in life.

{{ insert picture of aunt kathleen an I }}

My family was now watching my face swell up with sadness and fear, and stayed quiet. My aunt understood that this was probably the most I have ever messed up in my life and also stayed quiet. Squatting on my heels, I picked it up. There were noises coming out of it, and I felt the warmth and vibration of the fan and hard disk spinning inside it. Alive. The {{ RESOLUTION }} display Still showing the the norton commander window inside a deeply nested and obfuscated path directory structure, ending with a directory with six files in it named 0000001.BMP and the like. Seeing as I was on the verge of tears, my aunt called me a klutz and said that I was always a lucky little shit and to be more careful with my things.

{{ INSERT IMAGE HERE OF NESTED DIR IN NC }}

To say I was relieved would be cheating you. I was truly elated and relieved. This was little Alex on his marathon sex with the record shop girl, the sound of beethoven's 5th and pure victory and oneness, combined with ultraviolence and invincibility. This was IDDQD and IDSPISPOPD and a confusing wet dream at the same time. I was not only invincible but invisible, as my family did not find out about my girlsgirlsgirls directory and the computer survived the fall. My ThinkPad and I had defeated God himself. Confusing rubbing and grainy BMPs and my family never knew.

Interestingly, a previous experience in 3rd grade had already caused me to embrace atheism. An incident involving my 286dx desktop where I removed the memory from the motherboard and then because it was bedtime had to hastily re-assemble the computer before my babysitter saw what had happend led me to pray all night for god to put the memory back and I would never do it again.

The following morning I was an atheist and a troubleshooter. 

{{ beethoven's 5th moment }}

I was an evangelist from that point forward. All I wanted were thinkpads from then on. There was no doubt in my mind that every laptop I would own ever again was a thinkpad, in the same form factor, and it would treat me just as well.

Over the course of that machine's life, I replace the keyboard, the hard drive, upgraded the memory, and even replace the panel and bezel at one point. All within my reach as a child, given how well designed they were. It was solidified in my mind, that this was the machine for me, the clumsy but persistent tinkerer.

TODO: Clean this paragraph up chronologically. 

I moved back from London at 16, to start my Sophomore year in The New York City Public School system. Coming from international school, this was a shock, but I was returning with considerable savings from some savvy investing in a CD burner that my friends and I pooled money to get so that we could chip PSX consoles and burn games for a profit. We were killing it on the DreamCast market too because you didn't need to chip those, you just needed the {{ boot CD thing }} to play pirated games. 

{{ Spinning dog logo disc }} 

My school had a T3 connection in the library, and my friend Zac and I used an MS Word exploit we thought to have discovered to install Napster and Usenet Clients to download ISOs at school, then bring them home on IOmega jaz tapes to burn and flip for 10 quid each. The exploit was that you could use URLs in word documents to link to local media, and PCs in the library did not have the floppy drives locked down, so we could get a command prompt, or execute NC (Yes, I'm still using this) directly from a floppy and gain full control of the box.

{{ Zac and I in 8th grade photo }}

While most of our money went to a store in Camden called OddBalls because we liked juggling and yo-yos, I saved quite a bit of it and when I moved back to the states made the first big purchase in my short life since my Neo-Geo CD console, which clocked in at 160 GBP.

{{ Powerbook G4 }}

Need I say more?

OSX launched to the world not really giving a shit. I did. I knew what unix was. I knew that there was no way I could run linux or freebsd on a laptop and still have a browser and a usenet client that worked, and would hibernate when I closed the lid, and wake up when I openend it. I took a single look at the Titanium Powerbook G4 and knew I needed one. By any means necessary.

{{ 16 year old me in NY }}

{{ Danny's tobacco logo }}

I had already started smoking in year 8, since in the UK a tall 14 year old can buy cigarettes and booze without a problem. I quickly learned this was not the case in New York and formulated a plan to kill two birds with one stone. Smoke cigarettes, buy booze, and make enough money to realize my desire for a PowerBook G4.

By the way, week one of me being in a new high school in midtown was this:

{{ 9/11 photos }}

We lived in midtown so it was not like it happened on top of my school, but needless to stay, it was a unique way to start my first week of 10th grade, when I was "the weird british kid" in a new school, having moved back to NYC less than a week prior. I didn't know anyone, and I missed my lahdan town home and rudebwoy 2-step speed garage. I was heavily invested in that, and was not giving my identity up just yet.

Students in my school were constantly looking for deli's that would sell us cigarettes under the table, knowing we were FAR under age. I quickly learned that I could buy cigarettes online and flip them for $5/pack. My status became "the british accent kid from midtown with the $5 packs". It didn't hurt that a pack of newports went up to $6 just after 9/11.

{{ Beacon High schjool photo }}

Beacon had color printers that students could use, and a few Macs in the lab that had Photoshop on them. My solution to our booze and smokes challenge was making college IDs. I bought lamination pockets from staples, told people to bring me passport photos from a booth, and got a roll of the most valuable material known to fake ID producers under the age of 21. Holotape.

{{ Holotape roll photo }}

I started making IDs and selling them for $25, with absolutely no warranty whatsoever. When they were confiscated, people simply stopped going to that deli in the neighborhood, and eventually they were accepted when I got the John Jay College of Criminal Justice template down pat, as that was right next door to Beacon. Nearby stores accepted John Jay IDs with no problem, even for beer. 

{{ john jay ID }}

I moved on to buying Mini-thins and Stacker II's (ha! the Stacker III's were for idiots, post-ephedrine ban) in bulk, online and selling those too. Ephedrine was like cocaine to 15 year olds, and the drug experimenting population (everyone) in my school were about it, myself very much included. I lost all my weight by starting a onstop DDR career of whipping korean kids asses at Chinatown Fair, sweating like a madman from the mini-thins and stackers I was always on. Since arcades were more popular in the UK than in the US, I had a 2 year head start on the DDR playing population. By the time it arrived at chinatown fair, I had mastered beatmania, killed first and second mix of DDR, and was playing paranoia-180 on expert. Swag.

{{ chinatown fair }}

When I finally stacked enough paper, I bought a glorious 400mhz TiBook, a FireWire 4x cd burner in an external enclosure, and a FireWire HDD in an enclosure. It was on. I had a plan to recover the money I spent on it quickly.

Since I was an early adopter, and I quiclky learned that 9.2 applications didn't work at all in OSX, people needed software. 

Office. 
Adobe Photoshop. 
Final Cut. 
Cubase.
Pro Tools.

All of these things that I knew I could get on usenet, [hotwire](), or elsewhere. I saw the opportunity and ran with it. I started cutting school and became addicted to the hustle of going to people's houses on craigslist and "upgrading" their new macs with software they wanted. I even sold a compliation DVD with documentation and a script that I wrote for $25 that had all the common stuff people wanted, cracked and ready to install. 

Eventually, I was kicked out of High School for various reasons, including truancy, smoking, drinking, and all the usual reasons many many young men don't make it through their teenage years without a few significant detours.

#### A lul in the boring world of military intelligence

I left New York and joined the army, and was stationed in El Paso, Texas after basic and AIT in Georgia. Not much of interest for this story happened here, although I did continue selling bootleg games, I had other interests and a desktop PC that I played Masters of Orion on constantly. My focus was squarely on the love, lips, thighs, and hips of a certain lady I met in high school. I also started getting a salary and spending it on tattoos, so my desire for money was greatly reduced.

{{ pic of nora and I making out }}

#### Haaj, and getting a real job.

After I left the army, I started working as an on-site technician for a shitty IT staffing company called Insight Technologies, doing conversions of retail banks into other retail banks when they did hardware refreshes or were took over by other banks takeovers. The whole world was Windows-based and I needed a computer with a modem and an ethernet jack built in that I could carry everywhere and reliably drop on the floor.

I needed to log into Windows 2k3 domains and ensure that the DC could call home and was properly configured. This was not the job for my sexier-than-thou Powerbook. No, it was time to take my pilgramage home to the IBM ThinkPad.

There was almost no decision that needed to be made. I was a 20 year old IT professional. A refurb ThinkPad X-series from ebay was the only way. I knew from experience that if anything was wrong, I could probably fix it with more crap ordered from ebay.

{{ Thinkpad series I had }}

#### Trading systems and cold raised flooring

This thinkpad survived that job, and then another one where I spent a lot of time going to data centers and sitting on floors configuring networking equiptment and rescuing servers. The harsh reality of this was the dreaded cisco rollover cable and serial cables for switches. A serial port? On a laptop? Once again, ThinkPad to the rescue. I had a desktop at work that was amazing and super high spec and ran Windows XP x64, the same as our trading platform. My road warrior kit, however, was this tiny thinkpad and pile of ethernet cables.

It was at this point I started to run linux on a daily basis for all the supoprt machines for our operations. Firewalls, ntop boxes, netflow and packet capture for performance analysis. I became a linux guy through and through, and the next logical step was linux on my daily driver. As soon as I left my position after five years in trading operations, I began to run linux on my laptop. The computer I went with was another refurbished thinkpad x60.

{{ x60 }}

I bought one for my girlfriend too, she needed an indestructible computer that I could fix when she broke it, and got her to fall in love with the simple design, and long battery life, and the understated beauty of a machine that has decades of design experience built into it, meaning it shed the things no one needed or wanted. She got the tablet model because it was cheaper on ebay, and used it for just about four years before succumbing to the cult of mac.

This machine had an interesting feature that I tested to the extreme. The thinkpad had little holes at the bottom called keyboard drains, which routed liquid around critical components and into these drains if liquids were spilled on it. One night I was drinking a little heavily and watching cartoons in my bed, with a 24 ounce can of Coors balance next to the computer. I fell asleep, and when I awoke, the can was empty and the sheets were soaked. The computer was also soaked. The entire can of coors had gone through the keyboard and through the drains. The loop of episodes of aqua teen I was watching were still playing. My little thinkpad had soft, warm, beer breath coming out of the CPU vent on the side. 

I was even deeper in love.

#### Consultant badass

The next move was to ThoughtWorks, as a devops and automation consultant, where they give you the option of a Dell or an Apple product. As a man of principle who was used to have a real package manager and OS, I opted for the dell and left it in my living room to watch porn and drive my sound system. I spent my relocation bonus package on a refurb thinkpad x200s. The world balked at Lenovo's drop in build quality, but I didn't care. This machine lasted me over half a million miles in 2 years of near constant travelling to different clients, through new batteries, and memory and SSD upgrades. I had full disk encryption and a badass SSD before apple was even considering having it. I was running tons of vagrant VMs with ease on my tiny workhorse of a machine. We stayed together through thick and thin, until an unfortunate accident.
