This post is a long highly personal and autobigraphical about my emotional relationship with laptops. some personal and probably irrelevant choices to you, regarding the history of computers I have owned. The result of which is that I now have a Chromebook Pixel 2, running GalliumOS, and it is the best computing experience I have had up to this point. My position is slanted and unfair, and on top of that, I'm a linux user. If you are not interested in ThinkPads, linux as a daily driver, or the Chromebook Pixel, this is going to be very very boring.

My history with desktops is very different and far more common, so I've left it out. Laptops have been special to me because even as a child, I travelled constantly, and I believe my first flight carrying one was in 1991, at 6 years old. We flew a lot as a family because my mother travelled for work constantly.

### Toshiba on the teat

The first laptop I ever used was a {{WHAT WAS IT?}}. I played monkey island on it, ran Windows 3.1 sometimes, and was obsessed with the trackball that clipped on the side of it. I remember the contrast adjustment on the side of the screen being so intense, seeing the colors change drastically, and when point-and-clicks with friends, we all had to sit nearly on each others laps because the viewing angle was so terrible. It also had a monochrome mode that turned everything blue and white, which I would flick on and off while I waited for things to load from the internal floppy drive, because it was hardware driven. I remember trying to play DOOM on it but the refresh rate and ghosting was so bad that it was unplayable without memorizing levels and monster locations. Being 7 at the time, the solution was obvious. Memorize the game by dedicating every waking moment I was allowed near this machine to complete the game.

### ThinkPad first love

My first real laptop, meaning which I had sole ownership and agency over andwhich I had convinced myself to "get work done" was a {{ Thinkpad tiny one }} with an external floppy drive. It was given to me by my mother when she resigned from her job and they let her keep her work machine. It was loaded with Lotus Notes, Windows NT4, and a host of other software I could not have given a shit less about, but kept around just in case. At that time, I was programing in QBASIC, tearing it up in Norton Commander, playing LucasArts games, and pirating PSX games and CDs with the help of an enormous cd burner via my PCMCIA SCSI interface. This was my most prized possession, as it was the source of my young income and literally the coolest thing I had ever seen.

The defining moment in the relationship between myself and the ThinkPad brand was when I was in my aunts house, looking at porn on my laptop, in a heightened state of alert because everyone was home and downstairs. I think my aunt called me from downstairs, and in a frenzy I closed the windows with the images in it, and ran down the stairs holding my laptop in one hand and the bannister in the other. At the top of the stairs I stopped to think if I had closed _all_ of the things I didn't want anyone to see, and the computer slipped out of my hand. The next few seconds happened in unforgettable {{ HOW OLD MIND }} slow motion. I watched the computer fly out of my hand and cartwheel down the stairs, hitting one after another on different corners and gaining momentum untill eventually coming to rest at the landing after slamming into the wall right above the dog bed. The whole house heard it and thought I had fallen or something because I unconciously gave a painstaking squeal as the clamour echoed. The sounds it made were akin to the metallic and unmistakably mechanical crash of an expensive 35mm SLR slamming onto the hard, smooth, polished floor of the baggage claim area as an overtired father leans down to pick up an equally distressed screaming child, forgetting that the olympus with new zoom lens is dangling from his neck. Heartbreaking. Expensive. Utterly world-crushing and ultimately irrepariable.

I raced down the stairs after it and picked it up, knowing that I would never have a computer again. That was it. I saw the wreckage and knew that God found out, and now He has broke my laptop for being naughty. The catholic guilt was already turning my whole body deeply red as I saw that the clean, angular, and entirely utilitarian black body was chipped along the corners. The latch to hold the screen closed was laying by my feet. God had punished me for looking at grainy BMPs of a naked women laying on a checkered print duvet, with some other geometric patterns. I swapped a copy of commander keen for this filth [sneaker-net](http://www.sneakernet.com) style from a slovak friend of my babysitter who had a modem with a paralell port, and knew how to use BBSs. This was something I had sacraficed for mobility, early on in life.

My family was now watching my face swell up with sadness and fear, and stayed quiet. My aunt understood that this was probably the most I have ever messed up in my life and also stayed quiet. Squatting on my heels, I picked it up. There were noises coming out of it, and I felt the warmth and vibration of the fan and hard disk spinning inside it. Alive. The {{ RESOLUTION }} display Still showing the the norton commander window inside a deeply nested and obfuscated path directory structure, ending with a directory with six files in it named 0000001.BMP and the like. Seeing as I was on the verge of tears, my aunt called me a klutz and said that I was always a lucky little shit and to be more careful with my things.
