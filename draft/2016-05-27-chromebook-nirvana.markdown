TODO: Make a timeline, illustrated?


This post is a long highly personal and autobigraphical about my emotional relationship with laptops. some personal and probably irrelevant choices to you, regarding the history of computers I have owned. The result of which is that I now have a Chromebook Pixel 2, running GalliumOS, and it is the best computing experience I have had up to this point. My position is slanted and unfair, and on top of that, I'm a linux user. If you are not interested in ThinkPads, linux as a daily driver, or the Chromebook Pixel, this is going to be very very boring.

My history with desktops is very different and far more common, so I've left a lot of it out. Assume that in the gaps between laptops, I had some sort of desktop, and my first computer was certainly a IBM PC baby AT with a CGA display. However, laptops are special to me. Even as a child I travelled a lot on planes. My first flight carrying a computer  was in 1991, at 6 years old and have not since stopped travelling or carrying a laptop. We flew a lot as a family because my mother travelled for work close to 9 months out of the year, and frequently she took us with her. In the summer, we would fly to Vegas to stay with my family there, so my mother could travel for work. During those summers my sister and I would fly unacommpanied minor style to go meet her in places where she had to stay for a week or more to visit with us on weekends.

{{ when was the TSA formed? }} We would fly and I would carry the computer because I was the most interested in it. I was always afraid of the supposed magnets in the x-ray machines destroying my computer, so I insisted that they check my computer by hand and not run it through the scanner. The test to check if it was a bomb or not, was the often amused **airline** security guard would ask the 6 year old with the laptop to kindly turn it on and show that something showed up on the screen. This meant booting it, and wasting precious battery life, of which there was only around 18 minutes of on my first one. Upon the bios appearing on the screen, the guard would then wave me on with some comment about how cute or weird it was that I had a computer to my mother or me, and let out a laugh about how I must be really important, or from Wall Street, in New York, New York, the Big Apple! A place where many people had never been and thought of as very exotic I learned very quickly.

Thankfully I was awkward and shy and could just blush and close it up and get on with moving to my gate and begin thinking like a janitor to find a place to plug in. Very few people at this technology drought moment in time had portable electronics they carried around everywhere and were concerned about electricity.

### Toshiba on the teat

The first laptop I ever used was a {{WHAT WAS IT?}}. I played The Secret of Monkey Island on it, ran Windows 3.1 sometimes, and was obsessed with the trackball that clipped on the side of it. I remember the contrast adjustment on the side of the screen being so intense, seeing the colors change drastically, and when point-and-clicks with friends, we all had to sit nearly on each others laps because the viewing angle was so terrible. It also had a monochrome mode that turned everything blue and white, which I would flick on and off while I waited for things to load from the internal floppy drive, because it was hardware driven. I remember trying to play DOOM on it but the refresh rate and ghosting was so bad that it was unplayable without memorizing levels and monster locations. Being 7 at the time, the solution was obvious. Memorize the game by dedicating every waking moment I was allowed near this machine to complete the game.

### Learning about the guts of the boxes

Noting my interest in computers, in 4th grade my mother bought me what I now know to be a $5000, 4 week summer course in which we ordered a dell computer, and I hung out with a lady at the FutureKids center on {{ ADDRESS of FUTUREKIDS }} and she helped me take the whole thing apart, explaning everything to me, piece by piece. I learned about hard drives, ISA cards, RAM, SCSI (I didn't have it), IDE, on-board PC speaker vs SoundBlaster sounds, and everything else while we took it apart. Every day I was pining for the time I went to camp, even going so far as to watch richard scary's smalltown, which I hated, just because it passed the time right before I could meet up with Michelle, the love of my life. We put the computer back together in the same slow pace, quizzing me and joking around with me, and building my confidence in what I knew and didn't know.

After dell was back together, we installed DOS on it. She taught me the boot order, how the computer looked for a sector, and why the sounds coming from the machine came from the floppy first, the high pitched one, then a low pitched one, the HDD, then a click, then a beep. 
I was in heaven. This woman was so cool and so pretty to me, and she taking the next month off to cycle from NYC to California. For no reason. 
{{ Marina? }}

After installing DOS, we moved on to windows, and then to installing other software. Color inkjet printer drivers, a scanner, and paint shop, or some kidpix knockoff. The end result being able to edit a photo that I took, got developed, scanned, then opened in paint shop pro. This is where the image above came from. She taught me how to connect a sound card card and get it working, which I didn't own but she let me borrow because she was cool like that. We installed a few games, [The Incredible Machine](TIM_) I remember playing a bit of, before moving back into programming in QBASIC and tinkering endlessly with making menus for things and games in ZZT. Unfortunately, this was where it ended with {{ marina }} and I. She was off on her collosal bike trip, and I got to take my computer home and love and own for a very very long time.

### ThinkPad first love

My first real laptop, meaning which I had sole ownership and agency over andwhich I had convinced myself to "get work done" was a {{ Thinkpad tiny one }} with an external floppy drive. It was given to me by my mother when she resigned from her job and they let her keep her work machine. It was loaded with Lotus Notes, Windows NT4, and a host of other software I could not have given a shit less about, but kept around just in case. At that time, I was programing in QBASIC, tearing it up in Norton Commander, playing LucasArts games, and pirating PSX games and CDs with the help of an enormous cd burner via my PCMCIA SCSI interface. This was my most prized possession, as it was the source of my young income and literally the coolest thing I had ever seen.

TODO: Determine what the history actually was, noting that you did havea PCMCIA 33.6 modem at one point, and an ethernet card with an orange interface when you turned 16. I believe that is when the PowerBook G4 came out and you flip flopped for a few years.

{{ tech specs and photos of thinkpad }}

The defining moment in the relationship between myself and the ThinkPad brand was when I was in my aunts house, looking at porn on my laptop, in a heightened state of alert because everyone was home and downstairs. I think my aunt called me from downstairs, and in a frenzy I closed the windows with the images in it, and ran down the stairs holding my laptop in one hand and the bannister in the other. At the top of the stairs I stopped to think if I had closed _all_ of the things I didn't want anyone to see, and the computer slipped out of my hand. The next few seconds happened in unforgettable {{ HOW OLD MIND }} slow motion. I watched the computer fly out of my hand and cartwheel down the stairs, hitting one after another on different corners and gaining momentum untill eventually coming to rest at the landing after slamming into the wall right above the dog bed. The whole house heard it and thought I had fallen or something because I unconciously gave a painstaking squeal as the clamour echoed. The sounds it made were akin to the metallic and unmistakably mechanical crash of an expensive 35mm SLR slamming onto the hard, smooth, polished floor of the baggage claim area as an overtired father leans down to pick up an equally distressed screaming child, forgetting that the olympus with new zoom lens is dangling from his neck. Heartbreaking. Expensive. Utterly world-crushing and ultimately irrepariable.

I raced down the stairs after it and picked it up, knowing that I would never have a computer again. That was it. I saw the wreckage and knew that God found out, and now He has broke my laptop for being naughty. The catholic guilt was already turning my whole body deeply red as I saw that the clean, angular, and entirely utilitarian black body was chipped along the corners. The latch to hold the screen closed was laying by my feet. God had punished me for looking at grainy BMPs of a naked women laying on a checkered print duvet, with some other geometric patterns. I swapped a copy of commander keen for this filth [sneaker-net](http://www.sneakernet.com) style from a slovak friend of my babysitter who had a modem with a paralell port, and knew how to use BBSs. This was something I had sacraficed for mobility, early on in life.

My family was now watching my face swell up with sadness and fear, and stayed quiet. My aunt understood that this was probably the most I have ever messed up in my life and also stayed quiet. Squatting on my heels, I picked it up. There were noises coming out of it, and I felt the warmth and vibration of the fan and hard disk spinning inside it. Alive. The {{ RESOLUTION }} display Still showing the the norton commander window inside a deeply nested and obfuscated path directory structure, ending with a directory with six files in it named 0000001.BMP and the like. Seeing as I was on the verge of tears, my aunt called me a klutz and said that I was always a lucky little shit and to be more careful with my things.

To say I was relieved would be cheating you. I was truly elated and relieved. I was an evangelist. This was little Alex on his marathon sex with the record shop girl, the sound of beethoven's 5th and pure victory and oneness, combined with ultraviolence and invincibility. This was IDDQD and IDSPISPOPD and a confusing wet dream at the same time. My ThinkPad and I had defeated God himself.
