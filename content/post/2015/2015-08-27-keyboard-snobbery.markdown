Over the past few months, I have been exploring the interesting (and expensive) world of keyboards. 
Yes, keyboards. There are a couple of resources on the subject that I owe all this knowledge to, namely the [geekhack forums](http://geekhack.org), the [TMK firmware source code](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard), the [deskauthority forums](http://deskthority.net), and of course lots of trial and error. 

My path down this road came from a desire to build an [ergodox](http://www.ergodox.org/) keyboard when I saw one for sale on massdrop. I snatched one up, waited a couple of months, and when it arrived, busted out the soldering iron and got to work. I didn't take any photos of the process, but there are plenty of build logs with great photos all over the internet, many of them on [Reddit MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/). My build was uneventful, greatly aided by a multimeter and lots of patience. My real interest started not after building and learning how to type on this, but after cracking open the TMK firmware and seeing how it all works. 

## How does a keyboard work?

Some of this is cribbed from the well-written guide at [Massdrop's Introduction to Keyboard Programming](https://www.massdrop.com/article/introduction-to-keyboard-programming) written by HaaTa,
