# About The Author

I'm matt urbanski, a former sysadmin/developer now devops/programmer (see what I did there?) interested in functional programming, juggling, photography, and electronic music.

Professionally, I am a devops consultant with a deep interest in making shit awesome. I've worked in a few interesting places, but you can see all that in my [linkedin][3].

# About This Site

iflowfor8hours is a [hugo][4] based blog.
The blog compiles into static HTML with some javascript trickery to keep it pretty and simple. It's hosted on 
[digital ocean][2]. So far, I haven't had any problems with them, which is more than I can say about a lot of hosting companies.
